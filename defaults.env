# Global defaults for server bootstrap
# This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for default values.
# All scripts derive from this file — do NOT hardcode these values elsewhere.
#
# Override by setting environment variables before running bootstrap,
# or by creating a local override file at /${NAMESPACE}/configs/global.conf
#
# NOTE: Identity values (UID, GID, username, groupname) are NOT set here.
#       They come from BWS variables.env or are derived at runtime.

# Namespace name (root path is derived internally as /$NAMESPACE)
NAMESPACE="${NAMESPACE:-atn}"

# GitHub organization (derived from NAMESPACE by default)
GH_ORG="${GH_ORG:-${NAMESPACE}plex}"
